✅ Notes to Devs

All files are HTML mockups (not functional apps)

Use Tailwind for styling conversion

Behavior like modals, toggles, drag-drop = JS implementation needed

Convert to React: class → className, onclick → onClick, etc.

Suggest organizing into components (e.g., ProgramCard.jsx, WorkoutModal.jsx)

Let me know if anything needs clarification.
